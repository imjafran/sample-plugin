This is a basic clean WordPress plugin boilerplate as WordPress.org ready. This can be exteded or customized as on your own. 

## First thing first

- [ ] Install `npm-packages` using terminal/bash
- [ ] Change `NAMESPACE` from *SamplePlugin*
- [ ] Change defined `PLUGIN_HANDLER`
- [ ] Change stable-tag from `readme.txt`

```bash
npm install
```


## Scripting

SCSS to CSS (watch)

```bash
#admin scss to compiled css
npm run tailwind:admin

#frontend scss to compiled css
npm run tailwind:frontend
```

Bundle js through webpack  (watch)

```bash
#admin js 
npm run webpack:admin

#frontend js
npm run webpack:frontend
```
